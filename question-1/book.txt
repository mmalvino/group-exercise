On the main street of Crowfield stood a little old red house, with a
gabled roof, a pillared porch, and a quaint garden. For many weeks it
had been quite empty, the shutters closed and the doors locked; ever
since the death of Miss Nan Corliss, the old lady who had lived there
for years and years.

It began to have the lonesome look which a house has when the heart has
gone out of it and nobody puts a new heart in. The garden was growing
sad and careless. The flowers drooped and pouted, and leaned peevishly
against one another. Only the weeds seemed glad,--as undisturbed weeds
do,--and made the most of their holiday to grow tall and impertinent
and to crowd their more sensitive neighbors out of their very beds.
